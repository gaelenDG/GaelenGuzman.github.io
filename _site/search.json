I study microbiology and lipid biology – focusing on the manners in which host lipids influence the progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. I’m interested in a career in scientific communication and data science: I want to promote public health and Open Science by building a stronger bridge between scientists and the public.\nI’m a new father, so I don’t exactly have a lot of free time – but when I do, I enjoy hobby electrical engineering projects (see some of my projects above!), rock climbing, cycling, and enjoying those Pacific Northwest outdoors.\nPlease reach out to chat!"
